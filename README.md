## Hello everyone 🤗

My name is Luiza, and I'm currently studying software architecture and developpement at Epitech, in Nice, France. I've been coding for a few months now and I'm already in love with Java, but I also like Node.js and Ruby a lot. 🌹

These are some of my projects:
- 🪧 [Football Tournament](https://github.com/luizanbrg/test_technique) - A website to enter data and calculate the ranking of a 
fictitious football tournament, in Django and Django Rest Framework, done in 3 days only.
