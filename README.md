## Hello everyone 🤗

My name is Luiza, and I'm currently studying software architecture and developpement at Epitech, in Nice, France. I've been coding for a few months now and I'm already in love with Java, but I also like Node.js and Ruby a lot. 🌹

These are some of my projects:
🪧 [JobBoard](https://github.com/luizanbrg/jobBoard) - A duo project of a web application for a site with job offers (Node.js, React)
⌨️ [Login Page](https://github.com/luizanbrg/login-auth-api) - A simple login page in Java using JWT authentication and Spring Security
⭕️ [TicTacToe](https://github.com/luizanbrg/tictactoe) - TicTacToe game using JSwing
💭 [Portfolio](https://github.com/luizanbrg/portfolio-luiza) - My portfolio using HTML and CSS, only front-end

And my very first project, done in Ruby on Rails with a group of 3 people:
🐶 [DoggyNb](https://github.com/luizanbrg/doggynb2) - A RESTful API where you can find dogs to snuggle :)
